    <p>
      Good morning !
    </p>
    <p>
      It is really my honor to have this opportunity for an interview,
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope i can make a good performance today. I'm confident that I can succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now i will introduce myself briefly
    </p>
    <p>
      I am 26 years old,born in shandong province .
    </p>
    <p>
      I was graduated from qingdao university. my major is electronic.and i got my bachelor degree after my graduation in the year of 2003.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spend most of my time on study,i have passed CET4/6 . and i have acquired basic knowledge of my major during my school time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In July 2003, I began work for a small private company as a technical support engineer in QingDao city.Because I'm capable of more responsibilities, so I decided to change my job.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in August 2004,I left QingDao to BeiJing and worked for a foreign enterprise as a automation software test engineer.Because I want to change my working environment, I'd like to find a job which is more challenging. Morover Motorola is a global company, so I feel I can gain the most from working in this kind of company ennvironment. That is the reason why I come here to compete for this position.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I'm a good team player and I'm a person of great honesty to others. Also I am able to work under great pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s all. Thank you for giving me the chance.

      这是很多面试考官喜欢问的一个问题，这是你展示自己的最佳机会，不要吹嘘自己或过于自负，但要让雇主知道你相信自己，你知道自己的优点。如可答：“我认为我最大的优点是能够执着地尽力把事情办好。当做完一件工作而其成果又正合我的预想时，我会有一种真正的成就感。我给自己定了一些高目标。比如说，我要成为出色的毕业生。尽管在大学一年级时我启动慢了些，但最终我以优等论文完成了学业。”
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel that my strongest asset is my ability to stick to things to get them done. I feel a real sense of accomplishment when I finish a job and it turns out just as I’d planned. I’ve set some high goals for myself. For example, I want to graduate with highest distinction. And even though I had a slow start in my freshman year, I made up for it by doing an honor’s thesis.
